How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Saved potentially hours of manually searching for the errors

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Quickly identifying errors will vastly speed up your programming


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Advantage is having the control to save when you want so you can make comparisons when you want, disadvantage is if the program shut suddenly without you saving you could lose lot’s of progress and so would have to all that again.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
