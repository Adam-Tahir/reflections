When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are working on a project that would require you to use multiple machines, or if multiple people were working on the same project and were updating the project from different machines.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are used within the same repository. Clones are used to copy a repository from GitHub to your local machine, or from your local machine to another space on your machine. Fork is used to copy a repository by another person from GitHub onto your GitHub profile.
